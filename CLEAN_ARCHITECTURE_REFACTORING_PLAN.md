# Strmr Clean Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to refactor the Strmr Android TV streaming application to follow clean architecture principles. The refactoring will improve performance, maintainability, testability, and scalability while preserving existing functionality.

## Current Architecture Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
- Modern Android tech stack (Kotlin 2.0, Jetpack Compose, Room, Hilt)
- Repository pattern implementation
- Dependency injection with Hilt
- Paging 3 integration for efficient data loading
- ExoPlayer + LibVLC for robust video playback

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
- **Layer boundary violations**: ViewModels directly depend on repositories
- **Scattered business logic**: Logic spread across UI, ViewModels, and repositories
- **Insufficient domain layer**: Only one use case exists
- **Model coupling**: Database entities used throughout presentation layer
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Suboptimal database queries and memory management

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Performance**: Optimize database queries, memory usage, and network efficiency
2. **Architecture**: Implement proper layer separation with clean architecture
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design
4. **Testability**: Isolated business logic for comprehensive testing
5. **Scalability**: Support future feature additions without architectural debt

### Key Principles

1. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward toward the domain
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
3. **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on methods they use
4. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Testing Strategy

- **Domain**: Pure unit tests with no Android dependencies
- **Data**: Tests with Room in-memory database and MockWebServer
- **Presentation**: ViewModel tests with test doubles and Turbine for Flow testing
- **UI**: Compose UI tests for critical user interactions

### Performance Targets

- **App startup time**: < 2 seconds cold start
- **Navigation**: < 300ms between screens
- **Image loading**: Progressive loading with proper caching
- **Memory usage**: < 200MB average for streaming content
- **Database queries**: < 50ms for typical operations

### Migration Risk Mitigation

1. **Incremental approach**: Implement layer by layer
2. **Build checkpoints**: Test after each major step
3. **Feature flags**: Use flags for new implementations
4. **Rollback plan**: Keep old implementations until verification
5. **Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring during migration

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Priority Features**: Which features are most critical to maintain during refactoring?
2. **Performance Metrics**: Are there specific performance benchmarks you want to achieve?
3. **Testing Scope**: What level of test coverage are you targeting?
4. **Timeline Flexibility**: Are the phase durations flexible based on findings?
5. **Breaking Changes**: Are you open to any breaking changes in internal APIs?

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this refactoring plan
2. Set up development branch for clean architecture work
3. Begin Phase 1: Foundation Setup
4. Establish build checkpoints and testing procedures
5. Start with domain model creation and basic use cases

**Ready to begin implementation when you give the approval! 🚀**
