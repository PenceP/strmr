- **Async**: Coroutines + Flow
- **Build System**: Gradle with Kotlin DSL

## AI Development Team Configuration

Your project uses: Android SDK 35, Kotlin 2.0, Jetpack Compose, Room, Hilt, Retrofit

### Specialist Assignments

Since we don't have Android/Kotlin specific specialists, I'm configuring universal specialists with Android expertise:

- **API Development** → @api-architect
  - Retrofit service interfaces, API models
  - Repository pattern implementation
  - Network error handling, interceptors
  
- **Backend Logic** → @backend-developer
  - ViewModels, Use Cases, business logic
  - Coroutines, Flow, state management
  - Data transformation and mapping
  
- **UI Components** → @frontend-developer
  - Jetpack Compose UI components
  - Android TV specific layouts
  - Material Design implementation
  
- **Database** → @backend-developer
  - Room entities, DAOs, migrations
  - Paging 3 integration
  - Query optimization
  
- **Performance** → @performance-optimizer
  - Memory management, leak detection
  - Compose performance optimization
  - Video playback optimization
  
- **Code Quality** → @code-reviewer
  - Kotlin idioms and best practices
  - Android architecture guidelines
  - Security and API key management

### How to Use Your Team

- **For UI work**: "Create a Compose component for movie details"
- **For API integration**: "Add Trakt API endpoint for watchlist"
- **For database**: "Optimize Room queries for better performance"
- **For video player**: "Fix ExoPlayer HLS streaming issues"
- **For architecture**: "Refactor to clean architecture pattern"
- **For reviews**: "Review my ViewModel implementation"

### Android-Specific Guidance

When working with specialists, provide Android context:
- Mention target SDK version (35) and minimum SDK (30)
- Specify if it's for Android TV vs mobile
- Include relevant dependencies (Hilt, Room, etc.)
- Reference Material Design guidelines for TV

Your specialized AI team is ready to help build your Android TV streaming app!
